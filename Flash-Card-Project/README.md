# 🧠 Flashcard App - Python Tkinter Project

The **Flashcard App** is a simple yet effective tool built with Python and Tkinter that helps users learn new vocabulary through digital flashcards. Designed for language learning, this app displays a word in one language and flips the card after a few seconds to show its translation. Ideal for quick, focused study sessions.
